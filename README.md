# Intro #

`tty2gif` let you record scripts and their outputs into both binary and
gif formats.

Just like the original `script`, `tty2gif` first pomp up a temporary
shell where you can type in your shell commands. Meanwhile, `tty2gif`
will record both your inputs, and the output results. When you finish
recording, just execute `exit` in the temporary terminal. Finally,
`tty2gif` will store all above information into a binary file, named
`file.raw`. If you provide the second argument, named `out.gif`,
`tty2gif` will replay recorded process, and convert the it into a gif
animation.

`tty2gif` also can be used to convert an exist binary file into a gif
animation. Just feed it with an exist binary file name as the first
argument, and the output gif file name as the second argument.

Unlike other implementations, `tty2gif` provides a uniform solution
with a single simple C/C++ source file. I only tested it on Linux with
Bash. Feel free to report any bugs or port it into other systems, like
BSD based systems.

The `script` function part is inspired by the code in the book:
[The Linux Programming Interface](http://www.man7.org/tlpi/)

# Usage #

```sh
$ ./tty2gif file.raw [out.gif] [delay(ms)]
```

file.raw: output binary file name `OR` an exist binary script
out.gif: output gif animation file name
delay: change speed in milliseconds for gif, e.x., +10 or -10

For Mac users, if you want to produce gif files, you have to run `tty2gif` under
a `xterm` since we use X window to compose the animation. Also make sure
installed ImageMagick package has been built with X11 support, for example,
through `brew install imagemagick --with-x11`.

# Install #

`tty2gif` depends on the Magick++ library. If you need to optimize the output
gif (since v0.2), you have to have ImageMagick>= 6.8.6-4. After that, just
`make`
